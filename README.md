Based on the claude_neural_net.py script from the neuralNetworkAudioGen repository, here’s a README.md to help you understand and run the project:

🎶 Neural Network Audio Generation

Welcome to the Neural Network Audio Generation project! This repository features a Python script, claude_neural_net.py, designed to generate audio using neural networks.

📋 Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Python 3.x: The programming language used.
	•	Required Libraries: Install via pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	API Keys: The script utilizes OpenAI’s API. Ensure you have a valid API key.

🚀 Getting Started
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/MeDott29/neuralNetworkAudioGen.git
cd neuralNetworkAudioGen


	2.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set Up Environment Variables:
	•	Create a .env file in the project directory.
	•	Add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


	4.	Run the Script:

python claude_neural_net.py



🛠️ How It Works

The claude_neural_net.py script:
	•	Loads environment variables, including API keys.
	•	Interacts with OpenAI’s API to process prompts.
	•	Generates audio outputs based on neural network models.
